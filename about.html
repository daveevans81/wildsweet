            <h2>Wildsweet Studio's Story</h2>
	    
<p>Welcome to Wildsweet Studio, where clay holds stories.</p>

<p>Wildsweet Studio is run by Char-Lyne Evans, who is passionate about pottery and clay. She loves making timeless pieces reflecting the natural world and capturing the elements of living things into the sculptures she makes. s</p>

<p>For Charlyne, creating with clay is a way to be like a child again.  Following her curiosity, she plays with expressing the movement, mood and textures of living creatures.  She is an avid magpie of techniques and different mediums- using oxides, slips, and underglazes to add rich layers on her ceramic sculptures.</p>

<p>Her family has migrated in each generation since her grandparents travelled from China.  Growing up in New Zealand with Malaysian parents and now raising her own family in Wales, a sense of finding belonging runs through her body of work.</p>

<p>Folk tales have always given Charlyne inspiration to become a storyteller herself.  She hopes that her art may give you a moment to wonder impossible things that perhaps you’ve forgotten as a grown up. </p>
